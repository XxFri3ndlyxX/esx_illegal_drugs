# esx_illegal_drugs
This is the old esx_drugs which contain opium, weed, cocaine & meth.  
This was a fork from [esx_drugs](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_drugs) but they changed the way they do drugs and they only use weed now.  
This is why this is not a fork.  

**REQUIREMENTS**
This version is modified to use [FiveMIPL](https://github.com/XxFri3ndlyxX/fivem-ipl)  
You will also need [Teleport Script](https://github.com/XxFri3ndlyxX/Teleport)   
You will also need the latest [esx_policejob](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_policejob)  &  latest [es_extended](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)         


**INSTALATION**  
Put resource esx_illegal_drugs in your server 
Import esx_illegal_drugs.sql in your database  
Add this in your server.cfg:  
```start esx_illegal_drugs```   

**CONFIGURATION**
Keybind is C on keyboard or R3 on controller.  
Make sure your not a cop when attempting to gather/process/sell drugs.
Make sure that you set the number of cop desired in the config file.

**HOW THIS WORKS**  
Go to Weed,meth,opium or coke farm.  
Use the teleport script to get to the harvesting location.  
Start harvesting. (You can harvest up to 420 max, each 1 weed is = to 1G)  
Start processing the selected drug.  
(This will remove 28G from your inventory and will add 1 bag which will contain 28G.  You can process 420G to get a max of 15 bag)     
Now you can go and sell your drug.
